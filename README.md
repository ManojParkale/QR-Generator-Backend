## Description:
This Node.js project prompts the user for a URL, generates a QR code using the `qr-image` package, and saves it as a PNG file (`qr_img.png`). Additionally, the URL is stored in a text file (`URL.txt`). It uses `inquirer` for user input and `fs` for file operations.
  

Ideal for exploring modern web development and UI design!
